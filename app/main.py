"""
FastAPI application entry point for the pHera BFF service.

This module initializes the API application, configures CORS and registers
routers depending on the deployment mode.

Supported modes:

- beta:
    Lightweight proxy mode used for Beta integration.
    Only health check and BFF endpoints are exposed.
    No persistence or authenticated MVP-only routes are enabled.

- mvp:
    Full application mode with authentication and persistence enabled.
    Additional routes such as scans, history and trends are available.
